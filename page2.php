  <h1>Kasol: A Great Place for Fun and Leisure </h1>
  <p class="price">Kasol is on the radar for one and all! A lot of times, we get this question about planning a weekend trip to Kasol. The connectivity with cities like Delhi and Chandigarh makes it possible to plan a trip to Kasol on the weekend.

When the travel bug initially bites you – no other place has the same lure for off-beat-discover-the-world folk. The stories from Kasol are plenty, and the verdict is always the same – Kasol is quiet, yet adventurous – unleashing an experience of a lifetime. A Kasol weekend trip is a must for those looking for a quick escape to nature.

While it is true that Kasol is ‘not what it used to be,’ the place still has the same pull for a lot of people. It is because if you ignore the crowds of tourists, you can still capture the same feelings. These feelings include the beautiful green forested mountains, with the Parvati river flowing in the middle of the valley and little houses popping up on faraway lands. It is surely a scene that is always welcoming. </p>

    <h1>Other Important Tips when visiting Parvati Valley</h1> 
     <ul class="ulc">
        <li>
         While ATMs would be available near Kasol, it is better to carry sufficient cash for other places in the region of Parvati Valley. Cards will not work in most nearby villages.
        </li>
        <li>
         Carry a water bottle and fill it up when possible. Especially during treks, it is highly essential to stay hydrated. Also, always have a good pair of hiking shoes handy.
         </li>
        <li>
         Be Respectful of the customs of locals. Don’t be offended if the villagers avoid strangers in different villages. Also, don’t take pictures of villagers and particularly the kids without prior permission from them! 
         </li>
         <li>
         Goes without saying, but please do not litter or destroy natural surroundings if you have the right to enjoy it, then so should others that come after you. The sight of littered plastic/ beer bottles, cigarette butts is heart-breaking!
         </li>
         <li>
         Nearby regions to Kasol are known for producing some of the best Hashish which is due to the supporting climate. Hence, it grows naturally in this area. Even though locals consider it a plant, possession of the same is illegal in our country. Make sure you do not indulge in any unlawful activities on your trip to Kasol.
